The project's folder structure is centrally documented in a file named `repo_structure.yaml` at the root of the repository. Use this file as the authoritative reference when interpreting or reasoning about the layout and architecture of the codebase.

Before suggesting or making structural changes (e.g., where to place a file), consult `repo_structure.yaml` to ensure consistency with the documented structure.
